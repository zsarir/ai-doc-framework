## 🎯 The Story Behind This Project

### 🔥 The Problem: Skyrocketing Token Costs!

Imagine spending **$200 daily** just on AI model tokens for your projects! That's exactly what was happening - every time I wanted to fix a small bug, it cost hundreds of dollars in tokens and time.

### 🔄 Endless Loops and Incomplete Tasks

Some projects were so large that the AI model couldn't process all the data. Token limits forced it into endless loops, and many tasks remained incomplete. I had to manually restart them, wasting all the previously consumed tokens in the process.

### 🔁 Repetitive Error Cycles

The AI would fix an error with tremendous effort, then in the next task, it would **repeat the exact same error**! This meant wasting the same amount of time and tokens all over again.

### 📚 Documentation Hell in Large Projects

In big projects, I couldn't give the AI model documentation exactly tailored to specific tasks. The model was forced to read tons of irrelevant documentation, causing:
- **Horrendous token waste**
- **Skipped important sections**
- **Incomplete or incorrect task execution**

### 🎯 The Main Problems We Faced:

1. **Exorbitant Costs** - $200 daily just for tokens
2. **Incomplete Tasks** - Tasks that never got finished
3. **Error Repetition** - Same errors fixed a thousand times
4. **Wasted Tokens** - Reading unnecessary documentation
5. **Lost Time** - Hours spent on repetitive work
